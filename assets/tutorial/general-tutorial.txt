YACG is turn-based strategy game.
This means that actions you do are divided into turns.
Each turn you will earn gold depending on state of your economy,
all your units will have their movement points refreshed and all
your empire actions from cities will be refreshed too.
Cities play key role in the game, if you lose all your cities you
will lose the game. Cities provide you actions and increase your
country by expanding your borders. Also you can recruit units in
cities.
