Some technologies when you research them grant you access to goverment.
Goverment give empire-wide bonuses, but also have cons. You can check
your current goverment when you click "Overview" button under "Goverment"
entry. You can change your goverment by clicking "Revolution!" button and
selecting one option. Keep in mind that you can only change goverment when
you have full actions and by doing so your actions get zeroed, so you must
wait till next turn to build upgrades or recruit units.
