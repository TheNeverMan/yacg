Researching technologies is key aspect of the game.
You can manage all research-related aspects in "Science Ministry" and
you can see your currently researched technology and research progress
in top right corner. Your empire researches one tech at a time and each
technology has its respective cost, technologies get progressively more
expensive to research as the game progresses. Each turn some percent of
your income is substracted from remaining cost of researched technology
if remaining cost hits zero the technology is researched and new things
unlocked. You can check how much you spend on research in "Finance Ministry"
and you can change the percentage in "Science Ministry".
