Units are your army, they are necessary for defending
your lands, attacking and taking cities. You can recruit
units in cities and other upgrades that have "recruit" trait.
Keep in mind that recruiting units costs actions and units
require maitenance, so if you are running low on gold disband
some of them. You can move units by clicking on them and then
on a tile nearby. Units have their own movement points, which
are consumed by plundering, healing, moving and attacking, also
not every unit can move on every tile eg. deserts are inaccessible
for most of early game units. Units can fight if they are bordering
each other. If you want to attack with unit select it and then
click on enemy unit. Every unit has 100 HP, it goes down during
combat and if it hits zero unit dies. Units can capture enemy
cities by moving on them. Capture all enemy cities to win.
