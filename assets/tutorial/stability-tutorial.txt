Every city has its stability value from 0 to 100. Low stability
means revolts and additional spendings so keep stability of your cities
high. Stability will passively increase every turn however this effect
gets weaker with distance from capital and eventually gets negated.
Don't settle cities to far away!
Stability will also decrease when city is conquered, when city is other
nationality than yours and when random events occur (such as floods or epidemies).
You can increase stability of your cities by connecting them with roads, putting
unit in cities or revolting to more advanced goverment, but be aware that every
goverment change will decrease stability of your cities a bit.
You can always check all info about stability in your empire in Internal Ministry.
