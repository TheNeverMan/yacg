The main currency of the game is gold.
You can check your current gold balance and actions amount in top right corner.
Also you can see detailed report if you click "Finance Ministry" button.
Each turn gold producing upgrades that are in your borders will produce gold, but
all gold consuming upgrades and units will then consume their respective amount.
You can check how much upgrade consumes or produces if you click "?" button near
"Build xxx" or "Recruit xxx" button. Building upgrades and recruiting units
consumes one action, every city you have gives you one more action - after every turn
they get refreshed. You can build upgrades by clicking on one of tiles you own, and
then clicking "Build xxx" under Actions category on the right.
